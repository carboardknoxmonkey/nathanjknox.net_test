                Hello, and welcome to Nathan James Knox's official website! This site is a portal to everything that Nathan has.
                He will continually update this site until he decides to not or that this is a waste of money. You may have questions. Thankfully, I have answers!
            <br><br><br>
            
            1) Why does the site look like this?----<br>----I made this site myself using CSS and HTML. I also wanted it to look old. Mainly because I miss that 2012-2014 internet look. More functionality than prior but still had character. Every site looks the same today. So I made my website look like this so you may remember it!
            <br><br><br>
            2) What's with the bar on the side?----<br>----That links you other websites that have things that I made. the current links are as follows. My resume, if you want to hire me. My YouTube Channel where I upload videos I make. My Bandcamp Page where you can listen to all of the so called "music" I make
            <br><br>
            Now then, this site may have some updates on it so scroll on down to see what I have.

                    Hello there, this site is currently being hosted just to test somethings about how this site should work. It is one page, it links to the other sites that I want it. and it'll contain one page, and link to sites I want it to even after I update it and give myself a proper domain. But then I'll add more updates so that you can be informed.
